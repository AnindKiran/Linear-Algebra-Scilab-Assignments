The code for <b>Unit 1</b> consists of the following topics: <br />
(1) Gaussian Elimination. <br />
(2) LU Decomposition of the marix.  <br />
(3) Gauss-Jordan method to find inverses.  <br />
The solution is found for 3 X 3 matrices.  <br />


The Scilab code for <b>Unit 2</b> contains:<br/>
(1) Finding the span of a matrix (called 'mat') <br/>
(2) Finding the 4 subspaces - column space, row space, null space, and left null space - for a given matrix 'mat' <br/>
